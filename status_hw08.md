Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Kyle Smith

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/kylesmith-1/webdev-hw08/

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

http://events.devcalibur.com/

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

No, you are not able to send invite links.
While there is the ability to comment and respond to invitations,
there are no invite links. You still must be logged in to comment or respond.
There is also no table sorted by who is going and not going. 
There is also no ownership besides listing who has posted/said what, meaning
it is possible to delete things that should not be possible.
Also, navigation is unpolished. It is more or less still the default phoenix layout.
Going to http://events.devcalibur.com/ will always take you back to the original list
of events which may be helpful for testing.
Comments, responses, and photos are all working. Though I wanted response to not just
be text, I could not get that working.

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

Yes it is properly deployed.



And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
